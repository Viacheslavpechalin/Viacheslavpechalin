-  Hi, I’m Viacheslav Pechalin.
- I have been interested in programming since childhood and have always wanted to create my own application or website.
-And so, together with xlbry, we created an application like Usport.
-In this application, you will be able to communicate, call up and use the neural network to learn games you don't know
